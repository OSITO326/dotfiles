* Updates for Zim 1.x

See changelog in https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Thanks a lot for chosing Zim as the Zsh framework of choice for your
dotfiles and your courses!

I spotted a few points where the usage is not compatible with the
changes since Zim 1.0.0 (released 2020-01-07):
* The zimfw repo is not intended to be cloned for daily use. You only
  need the zimfw.zsh file. And downloading it from
  https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/releases/latest/download/zimfw.zsh
  will always give you the latest released version of it.
* .zimrc should only contain module definitions, and it's not sourced
  anymore when the shell starts.
* zhighlighters is deprecated in favor of ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS,
  since we're using the zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting module
  directly now.
* There are two separate zimfw actions: `upgrade` will upgrade the
  zimfw.zsh file itself, and `update` will update the modules.
  You usually would want to do both if you want to "up" everything...

* install zim inside the zsh dir
